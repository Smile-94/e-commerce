# Django Comprehensive Template: A Robust Foundation for Your Projects

The Django Comprehensive Template is a well-structured, modular, and highly configurable template designed to kickstart Django projects with best practices in mind. It provides a solid foundation for building scalable, secure, and maintainable web applications. Below is an overview of its key features and components:

## 1 Configuration Management with Pydantic

The template leverages Pydantic for robust and type-safe configuration management. This ensures that environment variables and settings are validated at runtime, reducing the risk of runtime errors due to misconfigurations.

**Key Features:**

- **Environment-Specific Settings:** Configuration is loaded from environment variables, making it easy to manage different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

- **Type Safety:** Pydantic ensures that all settings are of the correct type, preventing common configuration errors.

- **Computed Fields:** Dynamic configuration (e.g., database URLs, cache backends) is generated using computed fields, allowing for flexible and context-aware settings.

**Examples:**

```python
class DatabaseSettings(BaseSettings):
    POSTGRES_HOST: SecretStr = Field(default="localhost", frozen=True, repr=False)
    POSTGRES_PORT: int = Field(default=5432, frozen=True, repr=False)

    @computed_field()
    def DATABASES(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "default": {
                "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
                "NAME": self.POSTGRES_DB.get_secret_value(),
                "HOST": self.POSTGRES_HOST.get_secret_value(),
                "PORT": self.POSTGRES_PORT,
            }
        }
```
